# Manager's Help
  The "Manager's Help" application is a user-friendly and intuitive database system designed to facilitate the quantitative and financial management of an institution's assets. Built using the C# programming language, this versatile platform allows users to manage various types of inventories effectively. Key features include the ability to create user accounts with secure login credentials, register items with details such as name, quantity, unit value, purchase date, and expiration date, and modify inventory dynamically through adding or deleting items.

  The application incorporates two main database tables: "PERSONS," which stores user information such as names, emails, and passwords, and "OBJECTS," which maintains records of inventory items linked to user accounts. The relationship between these tables ensures secure and personalized management of inventory data. Users can interact with the application through four main pages: Home, Create Account, Login, and Inventory Management. Additionally, the platform includes validation mechanisms to ensure data accuracy and user-friendliness.

  Designed with scalability in mind, the application offers room for enhancements such as item sorting, notifications for expiring items, and the ability to modify individual item attributes without re-entering all details. The development was conducted using Visual Studio 2022, ensuring compatibility with modern hardware and software environments. "Manager's Help" is a reliable tool for both individual and organizational asset management, offering a blend of simplicity and functionality.
